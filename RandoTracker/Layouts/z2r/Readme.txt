ZELDA II RANDOMIZER TOURNAMENT LAYOUT HELP FILE

**This tracker was made in OBS Studio version 19.0.3 (64bit Windows)**
**1920x1080 RESOLUTION**





PLEASE IMPORT AND TEST THIS LAYOUT PRIOR TO SCHEDULING A RACE TO RESTREAM!





***IMPORTING***

First I would suggest you move/re-extract the contents of the ZIP file for this layout to "C:/Z2R TOURNAMENT LAYOUT" prior to importing.  Create a folder with that exact name (capital letters, spaces and all), and move/extract all the layout files into it (without being in any additional folders).  Then to import the layout click "Scene Collection" on the menu bar and then click "Import".  

This layout consists of a series of 1920x1080 images that are layered on top of each other to make for a consistent layout.  If you moved all the files into the suggested location above then everything should work.  However, if the images do not show up for you then you will have to edit each images location and point it to the location where you extracted them.

IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO EXPORT SCENES IN A MORE CONVIENENT WAY PLEASE LET ME (AngryLarry) KNOW!





The layout is broken down into the following sections:



====SET TRACKER OR LOGO====

If using the "Tournament Tracker", open it, then right click and select the proper window for the application for the "Tournament Tracker" source.  Make sure to uncheck "capture cursor" if it is selected as well.

TRACKER NOTES:  This tracker is prefered but optional.  Only those running a Windows OS will be able to use it (Sorry!).  If you are not using it please make this layered source invisible and then make the "Tournament Logo" source visible.  Two images were created for this space if you are not using the item tracker.  The one that looks like the Zelda II menu can be customized for you to add sprites, images or text to.

The Tournament Tracker is "borderless" but you can move it by dragging it from either side of the Item or Spell Locations labels and close it by right clicking it in your taskbar and selecting "Close Window".  The "Spell Locations" label is the "RESET" button in case you need it.

To mark item locations left/right click the area under the item or spell you are marking until you arrive at the proper location.  You may also be able to use your mouse wheel to set the items, but this does not work for everyone (trying to figure out why).  The locations are in symbol form based on the original tracker I created.  The symbols represents the "vanilla" item/location combination of the item area.  

They are in the following order (Original item in parentheses and in black & white on the symbol):

WESTERN CONTINENT
Trophy Cave (Trophy)
Magic Container Cave (Magic Container)
Heart Container Cave (Heart Container)
Medicine Cave (Medicine)
West P-Bag Cave (P-Bag)
Grass Tile (Heart Container)

DEATH MOUNTAIN
Hammer Cave (Hammer)
Specticle Rock (Magic Container)

EASTERN CONTINENT
Desert Tile (Heart Container)
Water Tile (Heart Container)
East P-Bag Cave (P-Bag)

MAZE ISLAND
Short Cave (Magic Container)
Long Cave (Kid)

NEW KASUTO
Old Lady's House (Magic Container)
Hidden House (Magic Key)

PALACES (Marked by Roman Numeral and not original item)
Palace I
Palace II
Palace III
Palace IV
Palace V
Palace VI

BLANK TILE

(cycles back around to Trophy Cave)



====RUNNER'S NAMES==== (SET ONCE PER RACE BEFORE GOING LIVE)

The font, size, and format of the runner's names are already set.  You will need to go into each area and modify it from race to race.  Each name will also have a "drop shadow" you will also have to modify.  Right click each layer, select properties, and set the runner's name.  Please use all capital letters and make sure what you type for each layer matches.

Announcer's names are set to a font size of 36 with the hope that it would fit 3 name's if a restream should include 3 announcers.  Reduce this size if needed then match the size used for the TOURNAMENT URL.

Tournament URL is static and should not be modified unless you changed the size of the announcer's names font.



====ROUND NUMBER==== (SET ONCE PER ROUND BEFORE GOING LIVE)

Each stage of the tournament has its own text and fun symbols for the top of the layout.  Set the one appropriate for the race you are restreaming.



====P1/P2 ITEMS/SPELLS==== (SET LIVE DURING THE RACE)

Here is where you will mark off all the items and spells that were found by each runner during the race.  When a runner picks up an item or spell make that source layer "visible".  This will just track who has what item.  Use the "Tournament Tracker" to then display the location of the item for the audience (and your own reference).



====P1/P2 PALACES COMPLETE====
This is where you will mark the completed palaces for each runner.



====LAYOUT OPTIONS==== (SET ONCE PER RACE BEFORE GOING LIVE)

If you are not capturing the individual timers for each runner then right click and set the properties of the "Timer" source to your timer application (WSpilt was used for this layout).

Leave the "Static" source layer alone as it is a fized part of the layout's design.



====IS DIGSHAKE RACING?==== (SET ONCE PER RACE BEFORE GOING LIVE)

If Digshake is racing you can set his half of the screen to be all swamp regardless of the other layout options you select.



====BORDER/TOP ROW/UNDER BRIDGE/ABOVE BRIDGE/SPELL BACKGROUND/ITEM BACKGROUND==== (SET ONCE PER RACE)

This layout enables the restreamer to customize the overworld of their layout.  Simply make visible the terrain types you would like to have in the appropriate areas prior to going live with your restream.

PLEASE MAKE SURE THE OPTIONS YOU SELECT LOOK PRESENTABLE.  Not all combinations of terrain types were tested.  Use your best judgement before going live.



CAPTURING GAMEPLAY WINDOWS

WHEN AVAILABLE PLEASE USE STREAMLINK TO CAPTURE THE RUNNER'S GAMEPLAY AND MAKE SURE THE ANNOUNCERS ARE ALSO WATCHING IT THIS WAY.  The layout is made based on a 13:10 ratio with the exact dimensions being 780x600 for this space.  If you are live, use "Studio Mode" to add, move and trim the captured area.

If you are also capturing the runner's timers the best available space for them are above the runner's names and towards the corner, on the same row as the tournament title & round.



ADDED SCENES

You may wish to add some scenes to this layout for the purpose of informing the viewing audience that a race is starting soon or thanking them for watching.  This is up to you however as templates for these sections will not be provided.
